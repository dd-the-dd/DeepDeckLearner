# DeepDeckLearner

DeepDeckLearner is the public AI laboratory for Deep Deck. It combines readable
rule-based agents, the production Oracle AI model and training code, and a local
React workbench for training and behavior tests. It contains no private model
weights.

DeepDeckEngine remains authoritative for Magic rules and legal actions. The
workbench consumes versioned sources from
[`DeepDeckEngine`](https://github.com/dd-the-dd/DeepDeckEngine),
[`DeepDeckPixi`](https://github.com/dd-the-dd/DeepDeckPixi), and
[`DeepDeckAgent`](https://github.com/dd-the-dd/DeepDeckAgent) as pinned Git
submodules. It does not copy their code.

Oracle AI is owned here rather than by Engine. Its observation encoders, V1–V12
architectures, PPO loop, self-play environments, checkpoints, evaluation tools,
League clients, and reproducible configurations live under `src/oracle_ai` and
`configs/oracle-ai`. Engine remains unaware of PyTorch, model versions, epochs,
losses, and checkpoints.

## Quick start for a Magic player

Requirements: Git, Python 3.10+, Node.js 22.13+, and a Rust toolchain for the
first local Engine build. PowerShell is optional. On Windows, install the Visual
C++ Build Tools when the bundled Rust linker cannot use an installed Windows
SDK. On macOS, install the Xcode command-line tools. On Linux, install your
distribution's C/C++ build tools and OpenSSL development package.

### Windows

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dd-the-dd/DeepDeckLearner.git
cd DeepDeckLearner
py scripts/workbench.py setup
py scripts/workbench.py start
```

The PowerShell convenience wrapper remains available as
`pwsh ./scripts/setup.ps1`.

### macOS and Linux

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dd-the-dd/DeepDeckLearner.git
cd DeepDeckLearner
python3 scripts/workbench.py setup
python3 scripts/workbench.py start
```

The POSIX setup shortcut is also available as `sh scripts/setup.sh`.

It opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Home first asks whether you want to **Train an
agent**, **Test an agent locally**, or **Send an agent to the League**. The Train
screen asks for the model, format, and one or more legal decks before its
deck-training action. It never starts a run or silently substitutes sample data
before that selection. Deck-driven training remains visibly blocked until
Engine publishes the versioned `trajectory-v1` collector.

The **Advanced trainer validation** disclosure can still verify the encoder,
model, optimizer, and checkpoint pipeline with a tiny built-in sample or an
existing JSONL trajectory. It is deliberately labelled as validation and does
not claim to use the selected deck pool.

For local play, press **Set up Engine + Pixi** once. The controller initializes
missing submodules, synchronizes the reviewed revisions, prepares Pixi, builds
Engine when necessary, and starts a sleeping Engine. Technical revisions and
individual recovery controls stay under a disclosure. Synchronization never
follows a floating branch and refuses to overwrite local changes inside either
public dependency.

The browser UI cannot launch arbitrary commands. A loopback-only Python
controller validates a small allowlist of training and playtest jobs. It never
sends your API key to React.

## What works now

- Train V11 or V12 from the built-in smoke samples.
- Train from a JSONL decision trajectory and resume a checkpoint.
- Prefer CUDA automatically and fall back to CPU when no compatible GPU is available.
- Configure trajectory input, CPU/CUDA, epochs, learning rate, and seed under Advanced.
- Run random, Alexios, V11, or V12 against a local Engine session.
- Inspect dependency readiness and bounded job logs.
- Connect an inference agent to Deep Deck League with your account API key.

Deck-driven self-play training and hosted weight updates are visible as
**unavailable** until the public `trajectory-v1` contract exists. The UI does not
substitute smoke data or call inference “training.”

## The two learning paths

### Magic-first

Choose the model family, format, and legal training decks. The primary action
stays blocked until the real deck trajectory collector is present. To verify an
installation today, open Advanced trainer validation and run the V12 sample.
The project-relative `.deepdeck/trajectories/decisions.jsonl` path and optimizer
controls stay there. The workbench creates that ignored local trajectory file
and its parent directory when it starts.

### ML-first

The public pipeline performs behavior cloning on the chosen legal action and
MSE regression on player-value targets. V11 uses four multiplayer value slots;
V12 exposes a two-player zero-sum value pair. The model scores only actions
declared legal by Rust.

Read [the deep-learning guide](docs/deep-learning.md) for the Magic-to-tensor
representation, dataset schema, checkpoint contract, and extension points.

## Test behavior locally

Start the public Rust server in a second terminal:

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path external/deepdeck-engine/Cargo.toml --locked --bin mtg-engine-server
```

After importing two decks into its local catalog, open **Playtest** and provide
their Engine deck-session IDs. The first seat uses your selected example; the
second uses Engine's `ai-random` controller by default.

The workbench starts and monitors the local agent. Pixi is a renderer package,
not a second server: the setup button prepares it, while a complete visual
playtest still needs its local-client host and a concrete session trace. That
remaining integration is shown honestly rather than fabricating game state in
React.

## Public examples

- `random`: reproducible random selection from exact legal actions.
- `alexios`: a readable priority policy for Alexios, equipment, protection,
  removal, goad, combat tricks, Food, and Clues.
- `v11`: recurrent PyTorch policy with multiplayer value estimates.
- `v12`: two-player variant with antisymmetric value estimates.

The original command-line interfaces remain available:

```sh
deepdeck-train v12 --smoke --epochs 2 --output runs/v12-smoke
deepdeck-example v12 --target local --checkpoint runs/v12-smoke
deepdeck-example alexios --target ddl --speed 1s
```

The complete Oracle AI implementation is also installed with the workbench:

```sh
oracle-ai-train --config configs/oracle-ai/train-smoke.yaml
oracle-ai-league-train --config configs/oracle-ai/league-v12-legacy.yaml
oracle-ai-v12-clients --help
```

See [the Oracle AI reference](docs/oracle-ai.md) for the production model,
self-play, checkpoint, evaluation, and League-runner contracts. Generated runs,
weights, trajectories, and local datasets stay under ignored local directories.

## Hosted inference and future online training

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then set your account-owned
`DEEPDECK_API_KEY`. The Matchmaking screen finds competitions and account-visible
decks by name, so users do not enter version identifiers. Catalog requests are
refused locally without the key and send it to Deep Deck League as a Bearer token.
The key identifies the account; the agent manifest remains free to describe its
own model/version. No browser login or `gcloud auth login` is required.

Playing a hosted match currently performs inference only. Training from hosted
play will require a compatible trajectory capability containing observations,
legal actions, chosen actions, rewards, and terminal placement. A replay is not
assumed to satisfy that contract.

## Dependency updates

The workbench applies only revisions pinned by this repository. It never follows
a floating dependency branch. After pulling a reviewed DeepDeckLearner update,
apply its pinned Engine, Pixi, and Agent revisions with:

```sh
# Windows
py scripts/workbench.py update

# macOS / Linux
python3 scripts/workbench.py update
```

Engine, Pixi, and Agent revisions are pinned so an experiment remains
reproducible. Updates are reviewed through pull requests and CI, rather than
following a floating `main` branch at runtime.

The [C4 architecture views](docs/epics/2026/08-august/deepdeck-learner/06-architecture-deepdeck-learner.md)
show the system context, local containers, protocol boundaries, and the exact
roles of Learner, Engine, Pixi, Agent, and the hosted League.

## Develop

```sh
# Run from the project root after setup, on every supported OS.
ruff check .
mypy
pytest
npm --prefix apps/learner-web run lint
npm --prefix apps/learner-web test
npm --prefix apps/learner-web run build
```

Only `@dd-the-dd` can update protected `main`. Everyone else can propose a pull
request. See [publishing and protection](docs/publishing.md).
